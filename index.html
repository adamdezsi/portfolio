            <h2 class="sectionheader">ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>I have just enrolled in Thinkful's immersive web developer boot camp and I can't wait to start. My experience with tech is pretty wide but I am 100% new to developing code. Wish me luck!</p>
            <p>Having worked for Amazon for the past two years I have developed a real amazement and appreciation for technology. It taught me how to work with all kinds of different people and teams, it also turned my interest towards developing software into a real passion. I started by building a quick little app that helped our warehouse achieve more with less resources, improved our loadout process and our metrics... From there it hit me hard that if I could do this much with very little self-education, my limits would pretty much disappear after enrolling in <strong>real</strong> education.</p>

            <h3>I have been a tech geek all my life, my interests outside of coding are as follows:</h3>
